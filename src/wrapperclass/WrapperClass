			The wrapper class in Java provides the mechanism to convert primitive into object and 
			object into primitive.
			
			# autoboxing and unboxing feature convert primitives into objects and objects into primitives 
			automatically.
			
			
			Primitive Type						Wrapper class
			
			boolean								Boolean
			char								Character
			byte								Byte
			short								Short
			int									Integer
			long								Long
			float								Float
			double								Double
			
			Autoboxing -
			
			The automatic conversion of primitive data type into its corresponding wrapper class is known
			as autoboxing.
			
			Unboxing -
			
			The automatic conversion of wrapper type into its corresponding primitive type is known as unboxing. 
			It is the reverse process of autoboxing.
