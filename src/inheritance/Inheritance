	Inheritance in Java is a mechanism in which one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of a 
	parent object. 
	
								Why use inheritance in java ?

		1.For Method Overriding (so runtime polymorphism can be achieved).
		2.For Code Reusability.
		
		
		                 -------------  EXTEND KEYWORD  -----------

	1. The extends keyword indicates that you are making a new class that derives from an existing class. 
	2. The meaning of "extends" is to increase the functionality.
	
								Types of inheritance in java
								
	On the basis of class, there can be three types of inheritance in java: 
	
				1.single 
				2.multilevel 
				3.hierarchical.		
				
	Java does not support multiple inheritance-
	 
	When one class inherits multiple classes, it is known as multiple inheritance.
	
							------- Single Inheritance Example -------
							
	
	When a class inherits another class, it is known as a single inheritance. 

	
							-------Multilevel Inheritance Example -------
							
									
	When there is a chain of inheritance, it is known as multilevel inheritance.
	
							------- Hierarchical Inheritance Example -------
							
	
	When two or more classes inherits a single class, it is known as hierarchical inheritance.
