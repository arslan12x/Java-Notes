		1.Object class is present in java.lang package. 
		
		2.Every Java class is directly or indirectly derived from the Object class.
		
		3.If a Class does not extend any other class then it is direct child class of Object and if extends 
		other class then it is an indirectly derived. Therefore the Object class methods are available to 
		all Java classes. Hence Object class acts as a root of inheritance hierarchy in any Java Program.
		
		Object class Methods ---

			1.to.String() --- 	toString provides String representation of an Object and used to 
								convert an object to String.

 			2.hashCode() ---   For every object, JVM generates a unique number which is hashcode.
 							   It returns distinct integers for distinct objects.

 			3.equals(Object obj) --- equals (Object obj) method is used to compare two object and its 
 									 internally uses hashcode method to compare object.

			4.getClass()  ---  getClass returns the class of an object.
							   It can also be used to get metadata of this class.
			
			5.finalize() ---   This method is called just before an object is garbage collected. 
							   It is called by the Garbage Collector on an object when garbage collector 
							   determines that there are no more references to the object.

			6.clone()  ---    It returns a new object that is exactly the same as this object. 
							  For clone() method refer Clone

		The remaining three method wait, notify(), notify All are related to Inter-thread Communication.
		
			7.wait()

			8.notify()

			9. notifyAll()
